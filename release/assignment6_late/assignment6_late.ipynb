The implications of this reach beyond just communication also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could potentially (minorly) upgrade the rate at which you distribute information by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking than others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!\n"

    "\n",
    "> This dataset explores the different languages across the world and how they translate and communicate information among speakers. While looking at the relationship between the number of distinct syllables and the information density, we discovered that the French language does not follow a trend similar to its European cousins and appeared to resemble more like Asian languages. With that in tow, we see that there is a strong positive relationship between the number of distinct syllables and the information density.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The plot from with information rate on the x-axis and the number of syllables on the y-axis, in contrast to the first plot, shows a negative relationship but this time between information density and speech rate. It appears that the faster the language is spoken, the lower the information density. It seems there is a trade-off between the speed at which a language is spoken and information density.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Segue into our last plots with information rate on the x-axis and the languages on the y-axis, we learn that most languages in our data have a similar mean information rate even though the distributions are quite varied. The language with the greatest information rate appears to be French and the language with the lowest information rate is Thai. That being said it appears that there is some limitation that prevents humans from processing information through language most efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Narrative B \n",
    "\n",
    "> Here we explored the amount of information conveyed by languages of European and Asian descent. First, we examined the relationship between the number of distinct syllables in these languages and their information density (i.e. bits of information per syllable). We discovered that as the number of distinct syllables increased, so did the information density. This finding could suggest that speakers from languages with a higher number of distinct syllables may have an advantage in conveying more information to others, compared to speakers who speak languages with a lower number of distinct syllables. Given that speech is how information is conveyed, we turned to spoken language and the rate of spoken language to see if such an advantage exists.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> To determine if more information is conveyed by one language group over another, we specifically looked at the rate at which syllables are spoken (labelled as speech rate). Here we observed slower speech rates for speakers of languages with a higher information density. This relationship is displayed in the plot with information rate on the x-axis and the languages on the y-axis. This finding suggests that there may be a balance between the information density of a language and the rate at which syllables of that language can be spoken. We hypothesized that there may be some cognitive limitations that are causing this relationship.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If there was indeed a human cognitive limit on receiving auditory information, then we would predict that the information receiving rate (referred to as information rate in our plots) should be a close range for all human languages. When we explored the the information rate for all languages in our dataset we observed that most languages clustered together around an information rate of 40 to 45 bits per second conveyed. There was some variation, however,. With English and French having the highest information rates, while Thai and Hungarian had the lowest information rates.\n",
